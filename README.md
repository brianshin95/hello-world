Hello, World!

My name is Brian and this is my first baby step to becoming (finally) a data scientist.

To be honest, I tried to take the easy path.

I finished my undergrad at the University of Waterloo, with a major in Statistics and a minor in Economics, back in 2018.
During my last year of university, I took a final-year stats course, which covered data analytics/machine learning concepts.
This was probably one of the most difficult courses I took, but it was interesting and I realized the potential in the growing future of data.
With no co-op or internship experience, I failed to find a full-time job right out of graduation.

After graduation, I pursued a certificate of Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics at Ryerson University while working part-time at TD as a teller.
My good friend, Harry Choi, helped me get the job. He also struggled to find a full-time job after graduation, and decided to work at TD as a teller.
After excelling, he told me that this is an amazing first step to my career, and that it's worth spending 1 year of my life to pursue something much bigger.
Harry, after graduating from University of Toronto, worked at TD as a teller for about 1 year, moved to TD Corporate as an Analyst for less than a year, got hired as a Senior Analyst at Loblaws Digital, and is now a Senior Analyst at Shoppers Drug Mart.
He really motivated me to work harder and that I should dream big at TD. I excelled as a teller at TD, becoming top 10 out of 1,700 other tellers in my first quarter.

During my certificate study, I mainly used R and SQL.
I already had some experience with R from undergrad, so the assignments and projects that I did with R at Ryerson were already things that I knew how to do.
I learned to use SQL for the first time at Ryerson. I learned to manipulate and pull specific part of a big dataset using SQL.

About 4 months prior to completing the certificate, I landed a full-time job at a Startup.
I currently work here as a Sales Analyst, mainly using Microsoft Excel to build sales reports for the company.
I've been working for more than a year and a half now, and my learning has stopped a long time ago.
I became lazy and stopped pursuing to further my knowledge in data analytics because I didn't need it for my job.

About a month ago (October-November 2020), I was looking for opportunities to become a Senior Analyst, but I miserably failed.
With COVID-19, the competetion was much higher, and I was not a much better version of myself from 2 years ago when I was looking for my first entry-level role.
After about a month of searching, I was hit by a massive rock of truth - I'm way too underqualified for a better job.
Or at least, according to my resume.
I have the skills and the quantitative background, but I haven't really showcased it properly.

Now, in December 2020, I am more motivated than ever to actually try to pursue the field of data science.
I'm going to try to use my knowledge in statistics and my technical skills to work on different data projects and build a portfolio.
First, I'll need to learn to use Github so that I could document my projects.

Tl;dr
1. Graduated undergrad with no co-op or internship.
2. Failed to land a full-time job straight out of graduation.
3. Pursued a data science certificate while working at TD as a teller.
4. Landed an entry-level full-time position as a Sales Analyst at a start-up.
5. Stopped trying to learn more about data analytics.
6. Tried to apply for senior/more technical positions and failed.
7. Going to properly pursue steps to becoming a Data Scientist.
8. Will start by learning Github.

Wish me luck!
